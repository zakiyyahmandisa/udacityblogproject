    <h2 style="color:green;"> Trader Joe's Za'atar Seasoning Blend </h2> 
    <p> You might be wondering, what exactly is Za'atar? Well, I consulted Sarah Jampel from BonAppetit for the answer:</p>
    <blockquote> Za'atar is so multifaceted and dynamic because it's a blend of so many different flavors, textures, and fragrances. Even though it varies greatly depending on where you are in the Middle East (specific recipes are sometimes closely-guarded secrets!), za'atar is generally a combination of dried oregano, thyme, and/or marjoram (woodsy and floral), with sumac (tangy and acidic) and toasted sesame seeds (nutty and rich). </blockquote>
    <p>She wrote a fantastic article about Za'atar, even giving you a recipe on how to make it yourself. Check it out <a href= "https://www.bonappetit.com/story/what-is-zaatar"> here! </a> </p>
